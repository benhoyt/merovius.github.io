**tl;dr: I come up with a couple of useless, but entertaining ways to generate entropy without relying on any packages.**

This post is inspired by a [comment on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/7qb74r/can_golang_package_source_with_no_imports_be/dso7xsc/),
saying

Now, the point of this comment was to talk about how to then compile such a
function into a deterministic finite state machine, but it got me thinking
about a somewhat different question. If we disallow any imports and assume a
standard (gc) Go implementation - how many ways can we find to create a
non-deterministic function?

So, the challenge I set to myself was: Write a function `func() string` that a)
can not refer to any qualified identifier (i.e. no imports) and b) is
non-deterministic, that is, produces different outputs on each run. To start me
off, I did add a couple of helpers, to accumulate entropy, generate random
numbers from it and to format strings as hex, without any imports:

```go
type rand uint32

func (r *rand) mix(v uint32) {
	*r = ((*r << 5) + *r) + rand(v)
}

func (r *rand) rand() uint32 {
	mx := rand(int32(*r)>>31) & 0xa8888eef
	*r = *r<<1 ^ mx
	return uint32(*r)
}

func hex(v uint32) string {
	var b []byte
	for v != 0 {
		if x := byte(v & 0xf); x < 10 {
			b = append(b, '0'+x)
		} else {
			b = append(b, 'a'+x-10)
		}
		v >>= 4
	}
	return string(b)
}
```

Obviously, these could be inlined, but separating them allows us to reuse them
for our different functions. Then I set about the actual task at hand.

##### Method 1: Map iteration

In Go, the iteration order of maps is [not specified](https://golang.org/ref/spec#For_range):

> The iteration order over maps is not specified and is not guaranteed to be
> the same from one iteration to the next.

But `gc`, the canonical Go implementation, actively
[randomizes](https://golang.org/doc/go1.3#map) the map iteration order to
prevent programs from depending on it. We can use this, to receive some of
entropy from the runtime, by creating a map and iterating over it:

```go
func MapIteration() string {
  var r rand

  m := make(map[uint32]bool)
  for i := uint32(0); i < 100; i++ {
    m[i] = true
  }
  for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
    for k := range m {
      r.mix(k)
      break // the rest of the loop is deterministic
    }
  }
  return hex(r.rand())
}

```

We first create a map with a bunch of keys. We then iterate over it a bunch of
times; each map iteration gives us a different start index, which we mix into
our entropy pool.

##### Method 2: Select

Go actually defines [a way](https://golang.org/ref/spec#Select_statements) in
which the runtime is giving us access to entropy directly:

> If one or more of the communications can proceed, a single one that can
> proceed is chosen via a uniform pseudo-random selection.

So the spec guarantees that if we have multiple possible communications in a
select, the case *has* to be chosen non-deterministically. We can, again,
extract that non-determinism:

```go
func Select() string {
	var r rand

	ch := make(chan bool)
	close(ch)
	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		select {
		case <-ch:
			r.mix(1)
		case <-ch:
			r.mix(2)
		}
	}
	return hex(r.rand())
}
```

We create a channel and immediately close it. We then create a select-statement
with two cases and depending on which was taken, we mix a different value into
our entropy pool. The channel is closed, to guarantee that communication can
always proceed. This way, we extract one bit of entropy per iteration.

Note, that there is no racing or concurrency involved here: This is simple,
single-threaded Go code. The randomness comes directly from the runtime. Thus,
this should work in any compliant Go implementation. The [playground](https://play.golang.org/),
however, is not compliant with the spec in this regard, strictly speaking. It
is deliberately deterministic.

##### Method 3: Race condition

This method exploits the fact, that on a multi-core machine at least, the Go
scheduler is non-deterministic. So, if we let two goroutines race to write a
value to a channel, we can extract some entropy from which one wins this race:

```go
func RaceCondition() string {
	var r rand

	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		ch := make(chan uint32, 2)
		start := make(chan bool)
		go func() {
			<-start
			ch <- 1
		}()
		go func() {
			<-start
			ch <- 2
		}()
		close(start)
		r.mix(<-ch)
	}

	return hex(r.rand())
}
```

The `start` channel is there to make sure that both goroutines become runnable
concurrently. Otherwise, the first goroutine would be relatively likely to
write the value before the second is even spawned.

##### Method 4: Allocation/data races

Another thought I had, was to try to extract some entropy from the allocator or
GC. The basic idea is, that the address of an allocated value might be
non-deterministic - in particular, if we allocate a lot. We can then try use
that as entropy.

However, I could not make this work very well, for the simple reason that Go
does not allow you to actually do anything with pointers - except dereferencing
and comparing them for equality. So while you might get non-deterministic
values, those values can't be used to actually generate random numbers.

I thought I might be able to somehow get a string or integer representation of
some pointer without any imports. One way I considered was inducing a
runtime-panic and recovering that, in the hope that the error string would
contain a stacktrace or offending values. However, none of the error strings
created by the runtime actually seem to contain any values that could be used
here.

I also tried a workaround to interpret the pointer as an integer, by exploiting
[race conditions](https://research.swtch.com/gorace) to do unsafe operations:

```go
func DataRace() string {
	var r rand

	var data *uintptr
	var addr *uintptr

	var i, j, k interface{}
	i = (*uintptr)(nil)
	j = &data

	done := false
	go func() {
		for !done {
			k = i
			k = j
		}
	}()
	for {
		if p, ok := k.(*uintptr); ok && p != nil {
			addr = p
			done = true
			break
		}
	}

	data = new(uintptr)
	r.mix(uint32(*addr))
	return hex(r.rand())
}
```

It turns out, however, that at least this particular instance of a data race
has been fixed since Russ Cox wrote that blog post. In Go 1.9, this code just
loops endlessly. I tried it in Go 1.5, though, and it works there - but we
don't get a whole lot of entropy (addresses are not *that* random). With other
methods, we could re-run the code to collect more entropy, but in this case,
I believe the escape analysis gets into our way by stack-allocating the
pointer, so it will be the same one on each run.

I like this method, because it uses several obscure steps to work, but on the
other hand, it's the least reliable and it requires an old Go version.

##### Your Methods?

These are all the methods I could think of; but I'm sure I missed a couple. If
you can think of any, feel free to let me know on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheMerovius),
[reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/7qfvzu/generating_entropy_without_imports_in_go/)
or [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16147475) :) I also posted
the code in a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/Merovius/283ff12a1186d001815485fca1094968), so
you can download and run it yourself, but keep in mind, that the last method
busy-loops in newer Go versions.
